# The user may have specified a different Gemstone user than DataCurator in createStone script. In addition, it could have changed the password of DataCurator.
# Therefore, the most reliable way to stop the stone is to grab the user and password either from the .topazini or the tODE description file.
# To avoid storing this info in yet another place, and since currently this is the only place where we must extract the user and pass,
# we simply extract it from .topazini using a perl script. This could be replaced by other means too
